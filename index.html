    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p id="Description">After releasing their 2012 full-length debut Night Visions (featuring the Grammy Award-winning single “Radioactive”), Imagine Dragons spent nearly two years bringing their passionately inventive brand of alt-rock to arenas around the world. To deal with the chaos of a touring schedule that included 130 headline dates and 50 festivals across the globe, the Las Vegas-based quartet threw themselves into creating material for their next album. “So many things were changing for us so quickly, the only way to feel some kind of stability was to keep writing,” says frontman Dan Reynolds, who founded Imagine Dragons with guitarist Wayne Sermon, bassist Ben McKee, and drummer Daniel Platzman. “Going up to my hotel room to work on new songs became something I looked forward to every night on tour,” Reynolds adds. “There were definitely a few times when the person next door’s banging on the wall because it’s 4 a.m. and they’re trying to sleep and I’m in there belting out some song I just wrote.”</p>
    <p>Live performance has always been essential to Imagine Dragons, who formed in 2009 and quickly earned a grassroots following by touring extensively and independently releasing a series of EPs. After signing to KIDinaKORNER/Interscope Records, the band made their major-label debut with the release of Continued Silence (a 2012 EP featuring the breakthrough single “It’s Time”). Once Night Visions arrived later that same year, Imagine Dragons soon found themselves on a skyward trajectory that saw the album climbing to #2 on the Billboard 200 chart, as well as the group taking home the Best Rock Performance for “Radioactive” at the 2014 Grammy Awards.</p>
    <p>Despite the whirlwind of the past few years, the drive to create sonically adventurous but unabashedly honest music has remained a constant for Imagine Dragons. And for Reynolds—who recalls sneaking onto his older brother’s computer at age 13 to use the recording software and sketch out songs about his early-adolescent heartache and frustrations—Smoke + Mirrors has proven his most daringly candid experience in songwriting yet. “At times it’s really scary to think about so many people hearing what I’m talking about in the lyrics on this album, but I know that for better for worse it’s completely authentic and genuine and true to who we are as a band,” says Reynolds. “And that’s the most important thing you can ever do as an artist, and also the most magical: forget about everyone and everything else for the moment, and just create whatever’s most meaningful to you.”</p>

    <p>Evolve (stylized as ƎVOLVE) is the third studio album by American rock band Imagine Dragons, released on June 23, 2017 by Kidinakorner and Interscope Records. After the release of their previous album Smoke + Mirrors (2015) and its respective world tour, a self-imposed hiatus for 2016 and cryptic messages from the band through their social media gained anticipation for their third album; it was finally announced on May 9, 2017, along with the initiation of its pre-order. In comparison to Smoke + Mirrors and their 2012 debut Night Visions, frontman Dan Reynolds called the album an "evolution" for the band.</p> <br>
